# PubDiscuss Frontend

> **Important note:**  
> This prototype currently implements only the functionality of the backend *concepts* from Assignment 4A (PaperIndex, DiscussionPub, AnchoredContext, and IdentityVerification).  
> It is a minimal working version intended for the **Assignment 4B check-in (Oct 21)** to demonstrate end-to-end reactivity and concept actions.  
> I will **expand the app substantially** for the final deadline â€” including richer front-end features such as a PDF/text viewer, persistent discussion threads, and full paper navigation.
